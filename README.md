# juicebox-docker

Please read the README at https://github.com/d4mation/wp-docker for basic usage instructions.

This required a lot of rework to work properly with the Bedrock+Capistrano setup, so I wanted to put this somewhere more permanent than my own local machine.

Clone the website repository to `./juicebox` within this one.

- `cap production wpcli:db:pull WP_HOME=https://docker.test` will pull down the database and import it into the database container.
    - Warning: Unfortunately, this doesn't do _quite all_ the search-replaces necessary and I am not certain why. Going to http://docker.test:8081 and replacing example-domain.com with docker.test will finish the rest of them.
    - Swap out docker.test/wp/? with docker.test/ as well with Regex enabled
- `cap production wpcli:uploads:rsync:pull` will pull down all the Uploads on the site
- Rename `juicebox/web/app/mu-plugins` to `juicebox/web/app/mu-plugins-bak`, create an empty directory at `web/app/mu-plugins`, and then `cd` into `web/app/mu-plugins` and run `git ls-files -z | xargs -0 git update-index --assume-unchanged`
    - There's a mu-plugin on this site that screws with `ABSPATH` and we don't want that.
- You may want to rename the "Rename WP Login" plugin temporarily in order to force-deactivate it.
- You may also want to disable the SMTP plugin. While it will prevent emails being sent due to an IP Address mismatch, MailHog can't capture them with it active
    - Be sure to copy back in the MailHog mu-plugin from the Docker setup! https://github.com/d4mation/wp-docker/blob/master/wp-content/mu-plugins/mailhog.php
